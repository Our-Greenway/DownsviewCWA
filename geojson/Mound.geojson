This large, grass-covered mound offers a great lookout point from which you can take in the park's diverse landscape as well as the city of Toronto. Once you reach the summit, you'll be rewarded with breathtaking views that stretch across the park and if it’s a clear day we’ll be able to see the CN Tower.","neighbours": [ "Hummingbird_to_NorthHill", "NorthHill_to_OtherPond" ] }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -79.476834687892961, 43.744604803138941 ], [ -79.477627961771503, 43.744324489600785 ], [ -79.478611114934822, 43.743347133526306 ], [ -79.477961800315114, 43.742581935560878 ], [ -79.476524276375031, 43.742978966346897 ], [ -79.476403560784547, 43.742991425034063 ], [ -79.476705349760095, 43.744629719834506 ], [ -79.476834687892961, 43.744604803138941 ] ] ] } }
