If you look up you’ll be able to see model planes which portray Downsview’s aviation history. These planes are the de Havilland DHC-2 Beavers. They were one of several planes designed by the Canadian aircraft manufacturer after World War 2 [WWII] by keeping civilian pilots in mind. This may have been due to the fact that civilian pilots may not be formally trained to operate a highly technical aircraft.","neighbours": [ "LakeLookout_to_Orchard", "BoakesGrove_to_LakeLookout", "KeeleDiana_to_LakeLookout", "KeeleWycombe_to_LakeLookout", "LakeLookout_to_SesquicentennialMonument", "LakeLookout_to_SwanLake" ] }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -79.482128857761637, 43.741333463521244 ], [ -79.482117044586985, 43.74107457867035 ], [ -79.482187923633049, 43.740975007275381 ], [ -79.482187923633049, 43.74081853760643 ], [ -79.482054040990676, 43.740696206489076 ], [ -79.481821715228079, 43.740582409877049 ], [ -79.481490946345829, 43.740556805609287 ], [ -79.481207430160964, 43.740588099712511 ], [ -79.481140488839799, 43.740664912442355 ], [ -79.481656330787246, 43.741100182716252 ], [ -79.482109169137232, 43.741364757218975 ], [ -79.482128857761637, 43.741333463521244 ] ] ] } }
